        <h2>Plot of We Bare Bear</h2>
        <p class="settext">
            We Bare Bears follows three adoptive bear brothers: Grizz, Panda (often called Pan-Pan) and Ice Bear. The
            bears attempt to integrate with human society, such as by purchasing food, making human companions or trying
            to become famous on the Internet, although these attempts see the bears struggle to do so due to the
            civilized nature of humans and their own animal instincts.[3] However, in the end, they figure out that they
            have each other for support.[4] The Bears often form a "bear stack", which they use to get around the city.
            The stack has become perhaps the most recognizable image from the show,[3] although they do travel walking
            on their own. Occasionally, the bears share adventures with their friends, such as child prodigy Chloe Park,
            bigfoot Charlie, internet sensation Nom Nom, park ranger Tabes, and produce saleswoman Lucy. Some flashback
            episodes chronicle the adventures of the bears as cubs trying to find a home.
